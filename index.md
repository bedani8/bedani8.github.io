### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I really enjoyed Lab 3 because it was the first time we got to incorporate operators into our code. We had to calculate a person's BMR. This lab showed how code can be useful for real-world tasks. Learning how to prompt the user was also very interesting.  

* Lab 6

    FFor lab 6, our task was to make a Madlib. This lab was very informational and helped me learn the concepts of index numbers and input validation. When users wouldn't provide enough arguments, we learned how to output an error statement that corrected the user and told them how many arguments to supply. 

* Lab 9

    For lab 9, we programmed a spell checker. Through this lab, we got a lot of practice with vectors and worked with other document files and how to use them in our code. We had a dictionary of words that we used to check if the spelling was correct. I liked this lab because I was a bit confused when learning about the concepts in the lecture, but after having hands-on practice, I understood the topics more.
